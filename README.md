This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

An incredibly simple react app that pulls data from a weather API, in this case [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org) and tells the user what the weather's like in their locality.

Pretty cool, eh? Nah, not really. But the fetch API used to build this app is!

## Usage

`yarn install`

`yarn start`
